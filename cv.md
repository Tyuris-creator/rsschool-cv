## 🙋🏻‍♂️ Briefly About Myself: {#about}
I am a 23-year-old student at Kazan National Research Technological University, majoring in Food Industry and Biotechnology. Throughout my studies, I have gained hands-on experience working in laboratories, ensuring product quality and adhering to industry standards.  

While my academic background, I have a strong passion for programming and technology. Computers and the internet have always been a big part of my life, and I am deeply motivated to create something of my own in the digital world. My curiosity drives me to explore new technologies, programming languages, libraries, and frameworks, as their vast possibilities align perfectly with my desire for continuous learning.  

One of my key strengths is my versatility—I immerse myself deeply in different fields and always strive to understand new concepts thoroughly. I am highly goal-oriented, self-motivated, and eager to improve my skills. Even though my professional experience in tech is still growing, my dedication to mastering new knowledge makes me confident in my ability to succeed in this dynamic field.

##  🤹🏻 Skills and Proficiency: {#skills}
1. GIT, GITHUB, GITLAB
2. HTML5, CSS3 (preprocessor SASS) 
3. JavaScript, TypeScript (basics)
4. Basic python
5. Basic knowledge or relational database SQL and non-relational database MONGODB
6. BEM methodology
7. Basic concepts of node.js
8. Basic C (pointers and memory allocation)
* Libraries
  + react (basic hooks)
  + react router
  + basic tailwind, bootstrap
  + express library for server side usage

## 🤓 Interesting problem that I solved using JS (Project Euler): {#code}
Problem 12: Highly divisible triangular number
The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:
1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

1: 1

3: 1, 3

6: 1, 2, 3, 6

10: 1, 2, 5, 10

15: 1, 3, 5, 15

21: 1, 3, 7, 21

28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over n divisors?
```
function* genTriangleNum() {
  let k = 1;
  while (true) {
    yield (k * (k + 1) / 2)
    k++
  }
}

function checkDivisors(num) {
  let count = 0
  for (let i = 1; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {
    if (num % i === 0) {
      count += (i * i === num) ? 1 : 2
    }
  }
  return count
}

function divisibleTriangleNumber(n) {
  const gen = genTriangleNum()
  let triangle
  while (true) {
    triangle = gen.next().value
    if (checkDivisors(triangle) > n) {
      return triangle
    }
  }
}
```
