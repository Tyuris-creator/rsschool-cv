        <p>
          My name is Michail and throughout my studies, I have gained hands-on
          experience working in laboratories, ensuring product quality and
          adhering to industry standards.<br />While my academic background, I
          have a strong passion for programming and technology. Computers and
          the internet have always been a big part of my life, and I am deeply
          motivated to create something of my own in the digital world. My
          curiosity drives me to explore new technologies, programming
          languages, libraries, and frameworks, as their vast possibilities
          align perfectly with my desire for continuous learning.<br />One of my
          key strengths is my versatilityâ€”I immerse myself deeply in different
          fields and always strive to understand new concepts thoroughly. I am
          highly goal-oriented, self-motivated, and eager to improve my skills.
          Even though my professional experience in tech is still growing, my
          dedication to mastering new knowledge makes me confident in my ability
          to succeed in this dynamic field.
